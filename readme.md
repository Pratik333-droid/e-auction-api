This is an api for my solo project e-auction.

e-auction is the online version of the on-premisis auction. It is developed to facilitate online auction for franchise based leagues like IPL. The auction creator, the players, the franchises and the interested viewers are the entities this app focuses on.

Functional requirements of the application involves the following

1. Anyone can register as an auction admin.
2. Only auction admins can create an auction which can be public or private.
3. Anyone can view the publicly available auctions.
4. Auction admin will create the franchises account for the auction he/she creates and provides the credentials to the franchises.
5. Players can register for the auction he/she is interested in.
6. A player can be elegible for the auction only if he/she is verified by any of the franchise
7. franchises can view the players that have requested for the auction that they(franchises) are part of.
8. franchises can approve the players they like. Only the players that are approved by any of the franchises can be the part of the auction.
